"""Check a recorded bootcamp transcript against the plugin's interaction invariants.

Deterministic and offline: no model, no judgement, no flake. Reads the
newline-delimited JSON that ``claude -p --output-format stream-json`` writes and
asserts the mechanically checkable half of
``.claude/skills/dry-run/phase3-conversational.md``'s watch list.

Why a linter rather than a judge
--------------------------------
Most of that watch list is countable, not debatable: "exactly one 👉 per turn",
"no `Module 4` in bootcamper-visible text", "no `or` joining numbered choices".
Asking a model whether a transcript "looked right" would turn those into opinions
and reintroduce the flake that makes a 3×/day suite unreadable. Every check here is
a count or a regex over text the Bootcamper actually saw.

⛔ What this does NOT establish
------------------------------
A clean lint is **not** a passed phase 3. ``phase3-conversational.md`` is explicit
that a walk can only show following the files *can* produce correct behaviour, and
that an assistant's own compliance is not evidence. This tool inherits that limit
exactly: **findings are trustworthy; a clean run is weak evidence.** It is a
regression net for changes that break a rule outright, not an audit.
