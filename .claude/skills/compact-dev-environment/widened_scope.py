"""Report invariants whose scope a later invariant widened without a pointer back.

`INVARIANTS.md` normally annotates the **earlier** rule when a later one widens its scope —
INV-083 carries "See INV-089 before implementing", INV-101 carries "Read INV-195 first". That
matters because the narrower rule is the one an implementer reaches first: it names the
concrete files, constants or artifacts, so a widening recorded only on the wider rule is
unreachable from where the work actually starts. INV-107 was the sharp case — it enumerated
two generators, and that exact wording is what let a third drift out of scope until INV-184
was needed.

⚠️ **This shortlists; it does not decide. Read every hit before counting one.**

On 2026-08-12 this reported **17** candidates, of which **15 were false positives** — sentences
naming an ID precisely to record that it is *unchanged* ("INV-041's and INV-042's exemptions
are unaffected", "INV-070/INV-071 still apply", "the guarantee remains INV-077"). A directional
verb near an ID means the sentence is *about* the relationship, not that the relationship is a
defect. Relaying this list as findings is how a clean result gets reported as a backlog.

⚠️ **It also has false NEGATIVES, and one of them was the case that mattered most.** This
scan would **not** have found INV-107 → INV-184, the sharper of the two 2026-08-12 findings.
It keys on a scope verb near an ID, and INV-184 states the widening without one: *"INV-107
named two generators; the property belongs to the pattern, and the third … drifted out of
scope unnoticed."* No "supersedes", no "generalizes" — so nothing matched, and that pair was
found by reading INV-184, not by running this. Treat a clean run as "nothing matched these
verbs", never as "no instance exists"; a widening described in plain prose is invisible here.

Why it is a report and not a test: the false-positive rate makes it unassertable, and a
genuinely one-way link is often correct — "extends INV-115 to profiling" leaves INV-115 wholly
true in its own domain, so no back-pointer is owed. Only a **scope widening** owes one, and
telling the two apart requires reading the sentence.

Its standing use is the revisit trigger for the stop-marker held on 2026-08-12 (see
`specs/generalized-invariants-leave-no-pointer-on-the-narrower-rule.md`): at a **third**
genuine instance, the candidate rule should become an invariant. Run it after any
`implement-spec` that supersedes or generalizes an invariant.

Usage::

    widened_scope.py [--repo <dir>] [--all-verbs]

`--all-verbs` widens the scan to "extends"/"hardens"/"complements" as well, which is much
noisier and almost never what you want; the default is scope-changing verbs only.

Exits 0 always — it is a report, and a hit is not a defect.
