"""Step 10's `record_type` guidance, and the retirement condition that keeps it from going stale.

`mapping_workflow`'s step-2 response contradicts itself about `record_type`: its instructions say
*"set record_type to `MIXED`"* on a discriminated source, while the **same response's**
`advance_schema` declares `record_type` as `enum: ["PERSON", "ORGANIZATION", "VESSEL", "AIRCRAFT"]`.
Sending `MIXED` is accepted and warns. Reproduced live on **MCP server 1.33.0, 2026-08-21** by
running `mapping_workflow` start -> step 1 -> step 2 with an 8-field mixed-type source:

    warnings: ["schema_plan[0] (watchlist_pep): record_type 'MIXED' is non-standard —
               expected one of: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, VESSEL, AIRCRAFT"]

So the plugin pre-empts it: send an enum-valid type and declare the mixture via step 3's
`type_discriminator`, which is where the tool's own prose says the typing happens anyway.

⚠️ **The point of this guard is the retirement condition, not the guidance.** This is a note about a
*current* server defect, and the repo has twice shipped a workaround that outlived the defect it
worked around — most recently the eval-license duration note, retired 2026-08-21 only because an
unrelated triage run happened to re-ask the same route. A note like this one must therefore carry,
in shipped text, the condition under which it should be removed; otherwise nothing in an offline
suite (INV-108) can ever notice the server has been fixed.
