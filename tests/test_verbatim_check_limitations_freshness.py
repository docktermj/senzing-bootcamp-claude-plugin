"""The verbatim-check limitations must say, per limitation, how fresh each one is.

`phase2-data-mapping.md` recorded three limitations of `sz_verbatim_check.py` and honestly
labeled all three as "**not** re-run against the current server … treat them as 'expect this,
and check'". Two have now been re-confirmed and one has not, so a single blanket caveat is no
longer the truth: it invites a reader to re-derive behavior that is known, while giving the same
weight to the one entry that really is unverified.

⛔ **What was re-verified here is the MECHANISM, from the scripts the server itself delivers** —
`download_resource(filenames=['sz_verbatim_check.py', 'sz_routing_report.py'])` and the live
`mapping_workflow` step-3 payload schema, MCP server 1.32.9, 2026-08-14 — not a re-run of a
mapping:

* `check_verbatim()` tests `if v.strip() not in allowed`, and `allowed_values()` builds only whole
  stripped values, `|`/`;` segments and whitespace tokens. The script's own docstring says
  "Equality against this set (not substring)". So a multi-word extraction is unreachable **by
  construction** — limitation 1.
* Both scripts define `load_jsonl(path)` as `json.loads(ln)` over non-blank lines, with no CSV
  branch and no `try` around the parse, and both are documented `<source.jsonl> <output.jsonl>` —
  limitation 3. The `JSONDecodeError` text therefore depends on the CSV's first line, which is why
  quoting one message invites "different message, different problem".
* `is_exempt()` is still `attr in {"DATA_SOURCE", "RECORD_ID"} or attr.endswith("_TYPE")`, so
  limitation 2's attributes remain outside the waiver — limitation 2.

**Updated 2026-08-21: limitation 2 is no longer caveated, and the caveat's own condition is why.**
This file used to assert that limitation 2 stayed flagged as un-re-run because verifying it needed
a source with **disclosed relationships** that was not available. A 2026-08-18 run had one. The
rejection fired, and it **widened** the entry: `REL_ANCHOR_KEY` and `REL_POINTER_KEY` fail too
whenever `record_id_source` is the `RECORD_HASH` sentinel, because the key then mirrors a derived
hash that is not a value anywhere in the source. The three assertions that pinned the caveat were
inverted rather than deleted — a guard that keeps asserting a claim its own trigger condition
disproved is worse than no guard, and the new assertions cover the refinement instead.

Source specs: `specs/reverify-the-three-verbatim-check-limitations.md`,
`specs/rel-key-attributes-fail-the-verbatim-gate-too-whenever-record-id-is-a-hash.md`.
