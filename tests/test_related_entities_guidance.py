"""Tests that the plugin routes `RELATED_ENTITIES` reads on evidence, not on an absolute.

Phase D's match-key audit originally sent the reader to both
`RESOLVED_ENTITY.RECORDS[].MATCH_KEY` and `RELATED_ENTITIES[].MATCH_KEY` as if both were
readable "from the loaded results", with no note that they might need different methods —
and an audit that silently measured only the first reported an empty cross-source
suppressor list, which reads exactly like a clean result.

**The fix over-corrected, and this file used to pin the over-correction.** Phase D was
given a ⛔ absolute — "Do not expect `RELATED_ENTITIES` from `export_json_entity_report`"
— generalized from one session's flag set. That absolute is false:
`reporting_guide(topic='evaluation')` documents each row of an export taken with
`SZ_EXPORT_DEFAULT_FLAGS` as carrying `RESOLVED_ENTITY` **and** `RELATED_ENTITIES[]`, and
its worked pattern computes relationship statistics in a single export pass (verified
2026-07-28); a live SDK 4.3.3 run agreed. The earlier session's rows genuinely lacked the
key because its flags were assembled from `SZ_ENTITY_INCLUDE_*` members, which do not list
the export methods in their `applies_to`. Both observations are real: **the flag set is the
variable, not the method.**

So these tests now pin the evidence-based routing instead of either absolute:

* neither file asserts that an export cannot return `RELATED_ENTITIES`
* both instruct dumping one row and routing on its top-level keys (INV-115/INV-149)
* the export-with-defaults case is attributed to the MCP reporting guide, not asserted
* the deduplication requirement is stated, since each relationship appears in both
  entities and an un-deduplicated single-pass read double-counts every one of them
* the defensive guarantees the earlier spec established — the reader-capability check, the
  three-outcome gate, no direct SQL — all survive unchanged
