"""Every artifact graduation is instructed to produce is named in its closing announcement.

Graduation is terminal. Its "Mandatory closing step" is the last thing the bootcamper reads, so
an artifact the flow writes and that step never names is one they never learn they have — which
is, from their side, indistinguishable from one that was never produced.

That happened. `render-any-bootcamp-document-as-a-styled-pdf` added Step 5b, which renders
`docs/business_problem.pdf` and `docs/data_source_evaluation.pdf` and tells the guide to "name the
ones that succeeded in the closing summary alongside the recap PDF". No such naming existed: the
closing step listed the recap and `production/` only, and the two PDFs appeared nowhere else in the
plugin. The spec's own criteria named the closing summary twice and its Affected files named it
explicitly; only the render step shipped.

It is the **third** recorded instance of one failure mode — a criterion naming a second consumer
where only the first was built (`relocate-integration-deployment-questions-to-module1`,
`defer-commonmark-to-graduation`, then this) — and INV-182 was written after the first two and did
not prevent the third. Nothing mechanical could: `coverage_reports.py affected` compares a spec's
predicted paths against the entry's `Files changed:` list, and `graduation/SKILL.md` *was* in that
list. It was touched, just not at the second site.

So this closes the class rather than the instance. It reads the `--output` paths out of
graduation's own bash blocks and requires each to be named in the closing step — so the *next*
artifact added to graduation cannot repeat it.

      worked invocation and names the second document only as `docs/<name>.md` in prose, saying
      "Render each" — so an `--output`-only derivation finds one of the two artifacts.

    That mattered: the first version of this guard swept `--output` alone, returned
    `['docs/business_problem.pdf']`, and passed while `docs/data_source_evaluation.pdf` was
    dropped from the announcement. A guard narrower than the property it claims is the defect
