"""A how call that names MATCH_KEY_DETAILS must request the flag that populates it.

Step 4c told the guide to call `how_entity` with `SZ_INCLUDE_FEATURE_SCORES` -- which the server
confirms IS the method's default -- while step 4b, ninety lines earlier in the same file, offered
`how_entity`'s `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS.CONFIRMATIONS[]` as the reason the how side is worth reaching
for. Followed literally the two did not meet: on **SDK 4.3.4** with that flag alone, `MATCH_INFO`
carried `['CANDIDATE_KEYS', 'ERRULE_CODE', 'FEATURE_SCORES', 'MATCH_KEY']` and `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`
was **absent** -- not present-and-empty, which is a third state step 4b is careful to distinguish.

⛔ **This is the why-side defect one method over.** The ⛔ that forbade
`SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` on why calls was withdrawn by
`specs/why-key-details-needs-the-flag-the-plugin-forbids.md`, whose criteria were scoped to **why**
calls throughout -- so the how call was never in its blast radius and kept the pre-correction flag
set. The lesson this guard encodes: sweep over the **claim** (which flags a breakdown needs), never
over the method that happened to surface it.

⚠️ **The server says three things about where this field lands and they do not agree** -- and this
guard requires all three to be recorded with none presented as governing (INV-169):

  * `SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS.applies_to` **includes** `how_entity_by_entity_id`;
  * that same entry's `response_paths` are `RELATED_ENTITIES[]` / `RESOLVED_ENTITY.*`, and its
    description attributes the object to *related entities* -- a shape `how_entity` never returns;
  * the how `response_schemas` document
    `HOW_RESULTS.RESOLUTION_STEPS[].MATCH_INFO.MATCH_KEY_DETAILS.CONFIRMATIONS[]` in full.

That is a coverage gap on the server's side, so the plugin must treat the breakdown as CONDITIONAL
rather than promised. A guard that demanded the plugin pick a side would be requiring it to invent
a Senzing fact (INV-080).

⛔ **The field spellings must NOT be harmonized.** `why_*` returns `WHY_KEY_DETAILS`; `how_entity`
returns `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`. Both are correct on their own method, and merging them would
reintroduce the defect `specs/why-response-carries-why-key-details-not-match-key-details.md` fixed.

Stdlib only; shipped markdown read as text (INV-108).
