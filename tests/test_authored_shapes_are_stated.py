"""Every Markdown shape a bundled generator keys on is stated where the guide authors it.

INV-242 binds all shipped prose, but the guard written with it checked one site: the recap's
image line. This file widens it to the rule's actual surface.

**Scope is Markdown, deliberately.** The bundled scripts also parse `bootcamp_progress.json`,
`bootcamp_preferences.yaml` and `data_sources.yaml`, and those are out of scope here because a
shape mismatch in them is **loud** — the stdlib parser raises and the step fails visibly. INV-242
exists for the silent case, which is a Markdown property: the document still renders, still looks
right to a human reader, and simply loses the treatment it was written to get. Two Markdown
surfaces qualify:

    docs/bootcamp_recap.md              <- bootcamp-onboarding/module-completion.md
    docs/bootcamp_data_discoveries.md   <- module-07.../phase1-query-visualize.md

The allowlists are read **from the generators themselves** rather than restated here, so adding a
label to `_NEW_LINE_LABELS` without telling the guide how to write it fails this file. A hardcoded
copy would drift the moment someone edited the generator, which is the whole defect class.

Found by taking INV-242's breadth seriously, 2026-08-14: the recap side was already compliant
(`module-completion.md` states `**Why it matters:**` four times), while the discoveries side
stated **neither** of its two labels in the form the generator keys on. Section 4 said to include
"at least one **near-miss**" and section 6 said "State the measurement" — both accurate prose, and
neither the `**Label:**` shape that triggers the layout. A guide following them wrote
"One near-miss: ..." and silently got inline rendering.

⚠️ Note `**Near-miss:**` alone does **not** match: `_normalize` maps it to `near miss`, and the
allowlist entry is `near miss the one that teaches more`. The parenthetical is load-bearing, which
is exactly the kind of detail INV-242 requires the instruction to state rather than leave to the
guide to infer.

Enforces **INV-242** — prose instructing the guide to author content a bundled script must parse states the shape that script accepts.

Source spec: `specs/recap-screenshots-in-bullets-never-reach-the-pdf.md` (INV-242's origin);
