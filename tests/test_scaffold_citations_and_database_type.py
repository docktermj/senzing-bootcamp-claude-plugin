"""Three seam defects a phase-3 dry-run walk found that reading the plugin cannot.

All three are cases where a step's own instruction cannot produce what the step asks for, and
where nothing downstream notices:

1. **Module 2 Step 4 cited one `generate_scaffold` workflow for two different needs.** It asked
   for a script that initializes the engine *and* prints the version, naming only
   `workflow='initialize'`. Verified live (server 1.32.2, 2026-07-29): that workflow returns ten
   snippets, all under `initialization/` — abstract-factory variants, priming, purge, destroy,
   signal handler — and **none prints the version**. The version snippet
   (`information/get_version.py`, calling `SzProduct.get_version()`) lives only under
   `workflow='information'`. The same file already carries this warning at Step 8a for a different
   need and cites the workflow correctly at Step 9, so the plugin had one correct use, one fixed
   use, and one still-broken use of the same workflow — the lesson had been recorded as a fact
   about seeding rather than as a rule.

2. **`generate_scaffold` never inlines code, and its own response advertises a parameter its
   schema does not declare.** The response is a listing (`file_path`, `raw_url`, `size_bytes`,
   `line_count`) with no source text, yet several steps said "save the generated code" as though
   code arrived. Worse, `access_steps` step 3 says verbatim *"call again with … inline=true"* while
   the tool's declared schema has only `language`, `version` and `workflow`. That is INV-160's
   trap — recorded there for `find_examples` — recurring unrecorded in a sibling tool. An
   undeclared parameter is not a fallback; it is a call that cannot work.

3. **`database_type` was read by two modules and written by none.** Module 4 Step 8b's SQLite
   load-time warning and Module 6's Phase A heads-up both read the key from
   `config/bootcamp_preferences.yaml`; grepping the whole skills tree found those two reads and no
   writer. Both steps treat a missing value as "indeterminate → say nothing", so the warnings could
   never fire, for any database or dataset size. Module 2 Step 7 — where the engine is actually
   chosen — checkpointed to `bootcamp_progress.json` with no specified shape, so there was not even
   a differently-named value to fall back to.

These are asserted against the skill text because that text *is* the deliverable: the guide follows
it literally, and a wrong workflow name or an unwritten key produces no error at the point of use.
