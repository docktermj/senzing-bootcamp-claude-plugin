"""On a why response the whole `MATCH_*` family is renamed `WHY_*` — not just the details object.

Module 7 warned, twice and correctly, that the match-key breakdown is `WHY_KEY_DETAILS` and not
`MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`. By naming only the *details object* as differently named, those warnings
implicitly reassured the reader that its neighbors were not. They are:

    WHY_RESULTS[].MATCH_INFO.MATCH_LEVEL_CODE   (string)
    WHY_RESULTS[].MATCH_INFO.WHY_ERRULE_CODE    (string)
    WHY_RESULTS[].MATCH_INFO.WHY_KEY            (string)
    WHY_RESULTS[].MATCH_INFO.WHY_KEY_DETAILS    (object)

`MATCH_KEY` and `ERRULE_CODE` are real names on the **entity** side — `RESOLVED_ENTITY.RECORDS[]` and
`RELATED_ENTITIES[]` — and appear nowhere under `WHY_RESULTS[]`. Confirmed from the route that owns
the shape: `get_sdk_reference(topic='response_schemas', filter='why_entities', language='python')`,
the document shared by `why_entities`, `why_records` and `why_record_in_entity`, **server 1.33.0,
2026-08-21**.

A `why_explain` program was written with `MATCH_KEY`/`ERRULE_CODE` out of entity-side habit and
caught only because Module 7 separately mandates reading `response_schemas` before parsing (INV-115).
Uncaught, all three fields render blank with no error — the silent failure the surrounding guidance
exists to prevent, one field over from where it pointed.

⚠️ **The rule this file enforces is a co-occurrence rule, not a spelling rule.** Anywhere shipped
prose introduces `WHY_KEY_DETAILS` *as the why-side name*, it must also name the two sibling scalars —
otherwise the reader is told the family diverges and shown one member of it. Sites that merely
reference the object in passing are exempt; the trigger is the naming/contrast context.

    ``MATCH_INFO`` keys from a flag probe. Scoping to the block fixed the guard.

    Attempt 2 then *also* passed — because the same block names the scalar **twice** (once in the
    bullet header, once in the field enumeration) and the mutation removed only one. That is the
    guard behaving correctly: the block still carried the fact. Removing both occurrences fails it,
    as does removing the entity-side contrast from ``phase1``. Two attempts that pass for two
    different reasons is exactly why "I wrote a mutation test" is not the same claim as "the
