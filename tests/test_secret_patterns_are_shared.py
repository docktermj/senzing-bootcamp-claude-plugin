"""`package_bootcamp.py` and `write-gate.py` scan for the SAME secrets (INV-109).

The write gate blocks a *write* whose content matches a secret pattern. The packager excludes a
*member* whose content matches them. Two consumers of one rule -- and if they drift, the packager
quietly protects less than the gate, in the one artifact the Bootcamper hands to someone else.

⚠️ **The gate keeps its own inline copy on purpose, and this test is the reason that is safe.**
`write-gate.py` is a `PreToolUse` control: an ImportError there does not degrade to "no secret
scan", it degrades to a hook that cannot run at all, on every write in the bootcamp. The plugin
already uses exactly this shape for `brand_tokens.py`, whose palette is inlined into two generators
with `tests/test_brand_sync.py` asserting the copies stay equal. This test does that job for the
secret patterns, so the duplication cannot become drift.

⛔ The comparison is on the pattern **string**, not on behavior sampled from a few examples: a
sampled comparison passes while a fourth alternation branch exists on one side only.

⛔ **What this file proves, and what it does NOT.** It establishes that the two consumers scan for
the same *patterns*. It does **not** establish that they apply them to the same *inputs*, and on
2026-08-26 they did not: the gate scanned every payload while the packager scanned only members
whose extension appeared in an allowlist, so a `.pem` private key was packaged while the identical
key in a `.py` was excluded. This file was green throughout, and its docstring claimed the
packager "cannot protect less than the gate" — true of the constants, false of the behavior.

So the equality below is necessary and not sufficient, and
`TheApplicationIsNotNarrowedByFileType` guards the half that was missing. The general lesson is
worth more than the fix: **a sync test on a shared constant says nothing about how each consumer
uses it.**

Stdlib only.
