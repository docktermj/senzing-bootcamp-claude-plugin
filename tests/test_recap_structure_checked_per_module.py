"""Recap structure is validated at the module that writes it, not eleven modules later.

A run wrote the four recap subsections as bold labels (`**Information Shared**`) instead of
H3 headings, at its first module, and reproduced that shape faithfully for all nine. Bold
labels render near-identically in every Markdown viewer, so the recap looked right the
whole way; the failure appeared at graduation, as:

    ERROR: refusing to render docs/bootcamp_recap.md
      - input does not look like a bootcamp recap: 0 of 9 '##' sections carry any
        recognized sub-section
      - catastrophic content loss: only 2% of the input's content would reach the PDF

⛔ **The generator's refusal is the thing that worked, and this spec does not soften it.** A
more permissive generator would have shipped a 2%-retention keepsake. What was wrong was the
eleven-module gap between making the mistake and being told: recovering it meant a
structural rewrite of the entire keepsake in the turn that was supposed to render it.

So Step 2c now runs the same `--check` after every append. These tests pin both halves —
that the step invokes it, and that the generator still refuses the shape it exists to catch.

⚠️ **The general form is worth more than this instance.** A validator whose only invocation
is at the end of an N-module run cannot bound the cost of anything it detects: every finding
is already N repetitions old when it fires. The three labeled summary blocks had already
been pulled forward into Step 2c for that reason; the enclosing heading was left behind
because it had not yet been the failure observed.
