"""The one-👉-per-turn rule is registered, and nothing cites the wrong invariant for it.

For the plugin's whole history until 2026-08-15 the rule `ground-rules.md` calls **"the #1
bootcamper complaint"** was stated in 13 shipped places, enforced with zero-tolerance
framing, checked at runtime by `auto-test`'s transcript linter — and registered in no
invariant. Six sites cited an authority and every one was wrong:

* **INV-005** is the 👉 *marker* rule in full — *"Each question to the Bootcamper is preceded
  by 👉."* A turn ending on three 👉-prefixed questions satisfies it completely.
* **INV-008** governs ambiguity ("not ambiguous with respect to a Yes or No answer").
* **INV-009** governs complexity ("not 'complex'. The use of 'or' is discouraged").

All 249 invariant entries were parsed and searched: four mentioned a per-turn count and all
four were **scoped** — INV-063 (model/effort switch), INV-064 (accepted-switch continuation),
INV-135 (licence-request flow), INV-225 (an observation). None stated the general rule.
(`specs/the-one-question-per-turn-rule-is-registered-nowhere.md`)

Enforces **INV-251**. Its companion is **INV-225**, which forbids the *zero* case; the two
together fix the count at exactly one, and INV-251 deliberately does not restate INV-225's
clause — duplicating a clause across two IDs is how they drift apart.

⛔ **WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT SEE — TWO LIMITS, both stated because one disclosure reads as all
of them.**

1. **The behaviour.** Whether a guide actually ends a turn on one question is a live-turn
   property. Reading files cannot establish it, and an offline suite (INV-108) never will.
   The only mechanism that checks it is `.claude/skills/auto-test/transcript_lint.py`, against
   real transcripts; `dry-run` phase 3 judges a live turn. A clean run here means the rule is
   *registered and correctly cited* — never that it is obeyed.
2. **Its own reach is a heuristic.** ``states_the_count`` fires on a line carrying the 👉
   marker, a mention of a *turn*, and a quantity word. That is broader than the phrase list it
   replaced — which shipped green over six wrong citations — but it is still a guess about how
   the corpus phrases things. A claim about the count that omits the 👉 character, or speaks of
   "a reply" rather than a "turn", passes unseen. **A clean run means no line matching this
   shape is misattributed; it does not mean no misattribution exists.**
