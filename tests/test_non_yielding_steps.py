"""A step that asks nothing must have a legal way to be executed.

Three rules collided with no legal move. INV-251: a turn never carries two or more 👉, and INV-225 forbids ending on none, so
presenting a statement-only step alone ends a turn with **zero**. "Advance exactly one step at
a time", so folding it into the next step's turn looks like advancing two. And the post-nudge
sequence said the reply turn ends "on Step 1's single 👉 question" — which Module 1's Step 1,
a privacy reminder explicitly labeled statement-only, does not have.

The obvious resolution was unwritten, so the guide had to break a rule and learn to read ⛔ as
advisory. The consequential form is not one step: Module 1 Phase 1 has four non-yielding steps
in a row, SDK setup has four on an existing install, and **System verification has exactly one
👉 in the whole module** — so a faithful walk generates code, runs it and loads data inside a
single turn, while three of that module's own instructions describe a mechanism it never
provides.

The fix names the concept once in the ground rules and decouples checkpoint boundaries from
turn boundaries. This file pins that, and pins the module that made it urgent.

Enforces **INV-225** — a step with no 👉 is non-yielding: it shares the next asking step's turn and never ends one.
