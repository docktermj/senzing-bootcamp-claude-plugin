"""Something deterministic must create the recap checkpoint, and every no-op must say so.

`docs/progress/recap_checkpoint.md` was never created across all ten completed modules
of a full bootcamp run, and `docs/progress/` did not exist — in a session that had
crossed a compaction boundary, which is exactly when the checkpoint earns its keep.

The reported root cause ("no step says to write it") was wrong, and the real one was
worse: **every operation on the file was automated except creating it.** The PreCompact
hook folds it, SessionEnd folds it, SessionStart folds it, module-completion clears it —
and writing it was a sentence addressed to the guide. A contract specified entirely from
the consumer's end.

Two things made it undetectable:

1. **The reminder could not fire in time.** It lived in the *PreCompact* hook, so it
   could not reach the model until a compaction was already under way — after the window
   in which the checkpoint had to exist for the fold to have anything to fold.
2. **`fold_checkpoint()` was a silent no-op.** Nothing distinguished "folded a
   checkpoint" from "there was never a checkpoint", so ten modules passed with the safety
   net absent and no signal anywhere (INV-111).

What ships now splits the job honestly. `ensure_checkpoint()` owns the file's
*existence* — deterministically, from a per-turn hook, so it cannot be forgotten. The
guide still owns the *narrative*, because no hook can author prose; what changed is that
its absence is now reported instead of silent, and the reminder arrives on the turn the
file is created rather than mid-compaction.

The scaffold must never be foldable. `generate_recap_pdf.py` warns when the recap still
contains a `RECAP-CHECKPOINT` block, so folding an empty scaffold would both append a
meaningless block to the recap and raise a spurious warning at graduation. The tests
below pin that a scaffold fold writes **nothing at all** — not even an empty recap.
