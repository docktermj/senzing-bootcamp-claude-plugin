"""Data collection describes SHAPE; only the mapping module says what a field maps to.

A guide recorded, in **both** `config/data_sources.yaml` and `docs/data_source_locations.md`,
that a CRM's `full_name` "needs splitting into NAME_FIRST / NAME_LAST" and that a loyalty
file's `"Last, First"` `member_name` needed "a different split". Reading the Entity
Specification at Module 5 reversed both: a single name field maps to `NAME_FULL`.

⚠️ **The reversal was cheap — no mapper existed yet — but the wrong plan had already been
committed to two documents a module earlier, where it read as settled fact.** Splitting the
names would have produced a mapping that loads and validates cleanly while degrading
resolution quality silently, which is the class Module 5 warns a quality score cannot detect.

⛔ **Two causes, and the second is the one the report missed.** Module 1 and Module 4 both
require a claim about *how the data maps* while the governing document has not been read
(sequencing) — and Module 4's own two examples of "mapping complexity", a joined name and a
free-text address, are **direct mappings** under that specification rather than
transformations. So a scenario generated to satisfy Module 4's notion of complexity could
satisfy none of Module 1's "at least one transformation" invariant through them, and the
module was teaching that a joined name is a transformation waiting to happen.

⚠️ **What is deliberately untouched:** the branch's other generation requirements — quality
bands, per-campaign duplicates, off-pattern values, record-key integrity (INV-180/INV-239) —
are real work and unaffected. Only the two leading examples and the inference drawn from them
were wrong, so these tests assert those requirements survive.

Verified on server **1.32.9, 2026-08-17** via `search_docs(category='data_mapping')`: the
specification's *Name > Feature: NAME* section documents `NAME_FULL` as the *"Single-field name
when type (person vs org) is unknown or only a full name is provided"* and rules *"Prefer
parsed person names … when available; use `NAME_ORG` for organizations; use `NAME_FULL` only
when the type is unknown or only a single field exists"*.
