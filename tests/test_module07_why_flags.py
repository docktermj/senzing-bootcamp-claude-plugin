"""A why demonstration must parse the field a why response actually carries.

Module 7 step 4b.3 told the guide to pass `SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` and explained it as
"the match key Senzing used to decide these records belong together". A why response carries
no `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`. The breakdown of the why key lives at

    WHY_RESULTS[].MATCH_INFO.WHY_KEY_DETAILS

confirmed on MCP server 1.32.9 (2026-08-14) via
`get_sdk_reference(topic='response_schemas', filter='why_records')`.

The flag names a different surface. `topic='flags'` reports `SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`
with `response_paths: RELATED_ENTITIES[]` and `depends_on` one of the five relations flags, so
what it *documentedly* populates is a `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` object on each *related entity*.

That is the silent-blank failure `ground-rules.md` → "Defensive parsing" exists for: a parser
written for the wrong field name yields None and renders as empty text, with no error raised.
The step's own prose was what pointed at the wrong name.

⛔ **CORRECTED 2026-08-17 — this file previously enforced a claim that was wrong.** From the
above it concluded *"on a why call it has nothing to attach to"* and asserted a ⛔ forbidding
the flag on why calls. That inference was never measured: the 2026-08-14 table it rested on
passed the flag in **both** arms, so the flag's contribution was never varied. On **SDK 4.3.4**
`WHY_KEY_DETAILS` was **absent** with `SZ_INCLUDE_FEATURE_SCORES` alone and **present** once
`SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS | SZ_ENTITY_INCLUDE_ALL_RELATIONS` was added; on **4.3.2** absent
without it. Following the ban produced a why demonstration with no match-key breakdown at all —
and because every other field rendered, it read as *"this SDK doesn't provide that detail"*.

⚠️ **What the server says is unchanged and still narrow:** re-verified on **1.32.9,
2026-08-17**, 29 flags apply to `why_records` and **none** names `WHY_KEY_DETAILS` in its
`response_paths`. So the field is documented and attributed to no flag; server position and
engine observation are held apart (INV-169), and no version floor is written from a matrix that
never varied the relevant term.

So this file asserts the step names the real path, that the flag is prescribed **with** its
relations dependency and its conditions, that every mention of it carries a qualifier, that the
composite-vs-member type hazard is stated, and that the pre-existing
`response_schemas`-before-parsing instruction survived. The field-name correction —
`WHY_KEY_DETAILS`, never `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`, on a why response — is untouched by the reversal.

Source specs: `specs/why-response-carries-why-key-details-not-match-key-details.md` (the field
name), and `specs/why-key-details-needs-the-flag-the-plugin-forbids.md` (this correction).
