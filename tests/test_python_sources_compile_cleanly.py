"""Every Python file in the repo compiles from SOURCE with no warning.

`tests/test_sdk_update_offer.py:175` carried an invalid escape sequence -- ``\\```` inside a
docstring -- for an unknown length of time. Today that is a ``SyntaxWarning``; Python has
scheduled it to become a ``SyntaxError``, at which point the file stops importing and the
suite stops running.

⛔ **THE SUITE WAS GREEN OVER IT, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE.** A ``SyntaxWarning``
fires when a module is **compiled**, not when a cached one is **imported**. Once
``__pycache__`` holds a ``.pyc``, every later run is silent. The warning surfaced only when an
unrelated one-line docstring edit (`d35046d`) invalidated the cached bytecode and forced a
recompile -- so the defect was found by accident, on a run that happened to touch the file.

⛔ **THIS GUARD MUST COMPILE SOURCE TEXT, NEVER IMPORT.** Importing is exactly what hid the
defect: an import prefers cached bytecode and emits nothing. If a later change "simplifies"
this into an import check, or into ``py_compile`` without ``doraise``/cache invalidation, the
blind spot returns intact and this file will report success while saying nothing.

Why it matters beyond one test file: `plugins/senzing-bootcamp/scripts/*.py` **ship to
bootcampers** and run under whatever Python they have, hooks are Python 3 exec-form
(**INV-052**) and the offline suite is stdlib Python (**INV-108**). A latent ``SyntaxError``
in a shipped script is a broken deliverable, which makes this **INV-004** (production-ready).

Nothing else in the repo could see this class: the suite imports, and `conformance.py`,
`citations.py` and `coverage_reports.py` all read files as text.
(`specs/bytecode-caching-hides-a-latent-syntax-error-from-the-suite.md`)

⛔ **WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT SEE.** It proves the files *compile* cleanly under the Python
running the suite. It does not prove they run correctly, and it cannot prove behaviour under
a future Python that has already promoted the warning to an error -- it only ensures the repo
is clean when that lands. A clean run is a statement about syntax, not about correctness.
