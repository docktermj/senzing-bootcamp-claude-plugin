"""No shipped file claims the why-key breakdown appears without the flag.

A guide followed the module's explicit ⛔ — *"Do not reach for
`SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` here … The CONFIRMATIONS and DENIALS named above are already
there without it"* — and its why-analysis renderer produced **no match-key breakdown at
all**. Probing the same record pair on **Senzing SDK 4.3.4**:

    SZ_INCLUDE_FEATURE_SCORES                                        WHY_KEY_DETAILS absent
    + SZ_ENTITY_INCLUDE_ENTITY_NAME                                  WHY_KEY_DETAILS absent
    + SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS | SZ_ENTITY_INCLUDE_ALL_RELATIONS WHY_KEY_DETAILS present

⛔ **The claim was inferred from a measurement whose two arms BOTH passed the flag.** The
2026-08-14 table varied the *relations* flags, not `SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` — so the
flag's contribution was never observed, and the conclusion was nonetheless stated in the
strongest available form and shipped as a ⛔. A negative about a flag is only supported by an
arm in which that flag is **absent**; where no such arm was run the honest form is "not
measured", not "not needed". That is INV-194's reasoning applied to a flag matrix.

⚠️ **The failure was silent and the directive made it look correct.** Every other analytical
field rendered, so a guide obeying the ⛔ faithfully concluded *"this SDK doesn't provide that
detail"* rather than *"a flag is missing"* — INV-179's shape, reached by following the same
file's own instruction.

⛔ **What must NOT be written either.** That the flag is *documented* to populate
`WHY_KEY_DETAILS`: it is not. Re-verified on server **1.32.9, 2026-08-17** —
`get_sdk_reference(topic='flags', filter='why_records')` returns 29 flags applying to
`why_records` and **none** names `WHY_KEY_DETAILS` in its `response_paths`;
`SZ_INCLUDE_MATCH_KEY_DETAILS`' own documented effect is a `MATCH_KEY_DETAILS` object on each
**related entity**; and `SZ_WHY_RECORDS_DEFAULT_FLAGS` is `SZ_INCLUDE_FEATURE_SCORES` alone.
Server position and engine observation are stated separately, neither governing the other
(INV-169).

⛔ **And no version floor.** Both builds were observed *without* the flag; only 4.3.4 was
observed *with* it. The evidence is equally consistent with "required on both" and says
nothing about a boundary — writing a floor would repeat the original error exactly.
