"""An animated view captured without its settled signal must be REPORTED, not passed off.

INV-298 has two halves. The capture waits on the layout's own settled signal
(``data-graph-settled`` on the document element), and **a capture that proceeds without it
must say so**. This guards the second half, which is the half that needs no layout decision:

* the graph tab captured with the signal present   -> manifest ``settled``, stderr silent
* the graph tab captured without it                -> manifest ``unsettled``, stderr reports it
* a static tab, which never animates               -> manifest ``n/a``, stderr silent

⛔ **``unsettled`` and ``unknown`` are different findings and are kept apart deliberately.**
``unsettled`` means the page was asked and said no; ``unknown`` means the backend cannot read
the DOM at all (``wkhtmltoimage``). Reporting a backend limitation as an unsettled layout blames
the artifact for the instrument, which is the reverse of what INV-129 asks for -- so an animated
tab starts at ``unknown`` and only a backend that actually read the attribute may downgrade it.

⚠️ **Why this matters more than it looks.** Measured 2026-09-03 through this helper's own path on
the 85-entity Truth Set, the force layout advances about **five of the ~300 ticks** it needs, at
every virtual-time budget from 5s to 300s, because d3's timer is driven by
``requestAnimationFrame`` and headless virtual time does not advance it. So today this reports
``unsettled`` on every real graph capture -- correctly. The image is still written, because
capture is best-effort by contract (INV-122) and an unfinished layout is still the best available
view; what changed is that it no longer ships silently
(``specs/graph-capture-budget-does-not-converge-at-truth-set-density.md``).

Stdlib only; the script is run as a subprocess and never imported from ``plugins/`` (INV-108).
