"""A high possible-match rate is a finding; only a mapping-actionable one reaches Module 5.

Enforces **INV-264** — a quality band MUST NOT by itself route the Bootcamper into remediation;
the step MUST establish whether the cause is a data characteristic or a mapping defect first.
Registered 2026-08-21 at the maintainer's sign-off, with all three band-routing sites recorded.

Step 3b bands the possible-match rate and routed **Poor** (>15%) straight to *"The results suggest
mapping improvements would help"* plus the Module 5 remap loop. A run measured **48.9%** and the
sampled evidence showed the cause was not a mapping defect: about half the near-misses came from one
source's genuinely empty contact fields (PHONE 45.7% populated, ADDRESS_LINE1 55% -- correctly
mapped, the values simply absent from the source), and the rest from coincidental full-name
collisions in a synthetic generator's limited name pool. Neither is fixable by remapping. The loop
was offered anyway, accepted, and had nothing to change.

**The band was acting as a diagnosis.** The old wording said the shared match-key pattern *is* what
points at an unmapped feature, so the evidence was gathered and then narrated toward a conclusion the
band had already reached -- nothing let the evidence cancel the offer.

⚠️ **This is not what `step3b-quality-lookup-misroutes-and-omits-the-evidence-requirement` fixed.**
That spec added the sample-and-show requirement and said explicitly that it changed *what the guide
must show, not where the bands sit*. The evidence is now collected. What was still missing is that it
**decides**.

**The server states all three of the things the plugin was missing** (re-asked on
`reporting_guide(topic='evaluation', language='python')`, server **1.33.0, 2026-08-21**): the
diagnosis is conditional on **concentration** rather than on the rate; it is hedged as **likely**;
and it names **two** causes -- "unmapped **or has data quality issues**" -- of which the plugin
carried only the first. The same response also supplies the discriminator the plugin never ran, the
profiler-uniqueness sanity comparison.

⚠️ **The thresholds are deliberately untouched.** `< 5%` / `5-15%` / `> 15%` still decide whether to
look hard; this spec changed only what may follow from looking. `TheThresholdsAreUnchanged` pins them.
